							<h3>Zone HR Monitor</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Zone utilises the latest non-invasive optical sensors to collect cardiorespiratory signals from the client. Designed to be worn on the wrist, the Zone is lightweight and compact, as well as being waterproof - so you truly can wear it round-the-clock for optimal fidelity on your biosignal collection.</p>
							<p>Observing trends in RHR, daily or intermittent exertion, and HRV, wearing the Zone 24/7 allows the system to truly get to know the real you. Your data is securely updated regularly and is visible to both you and your doctor, helping to provide the clearest understanding of your cardiac health over time.</p>
							<p>The Zone isn’t just an activity tracker. While deeper analysis of trends in data is facilitated through our Pulse Logistics software and informed by your doctor, the Zone is also fitted with an optional, mutable alarm system to emergency services for specific high-risk groups. Even if you’re on your own and something goes wrong, you can have confidence that help isn’t far away. Zone’s got your back.</p>
							<h3>Zone HR+</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>For those who need even more from their wearable, we developed the Zone HR+ The same great technology that we used in our original device, with the added utility of a blood pressure strap.</p>
