							<p>Cardiotronics recognised that smart devices had become increasingly fashionable in recent years. However, while features are marketed towards productivity as well as towards healthier people interested in self-quantification, the majority of devices offered little to at-risk populations with existing cardiorespiratory risk factors. Furthermore, biosensors in many of these devices and the algorithms used to interpret client data were of varying standards.</p>
							<p>In a post-COVID 19 world, medical systems can be overburdened quickly, Telehealth services are on the rise for isolated populations, and not all at-risk patients can get appointments to see medical practitioners when necessary. Services that could assist in patient triage and expedite medical response and diagnosis were needed.</p>
							<p>Therefore, Cardiotronics set out to develop a range of products aimed at monitoring and analysing cardiorespiratory health in at-risk clients. Our vision is to improve quality of life for Australians while bringing healthcare into a new era. Optional alarms to emergency services, gold-standard data collection and integrated analysis software combine to reduce response times and close the distance between clients and medical staff.</p>							
							<br>
							<h1>Our Mission</h1>
							<p>Cardiotronics is dedicated to improving the quality of healthcare products and services to meet the demands of modern society. Our mission is to help at-risk populations in Australia live better lives by offering gold-standard cardiorespiratory health analysis and integrated diagnostic tools.</p>
