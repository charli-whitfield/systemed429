									<h3>The Base Station</h3>
									<p>In an effort to provide greater context to your medical diagnosis and support long term quantitative health tracking, Cardiotronics developed a range of products designed for at-home use. Used on their own, or in concert with the Zone HR and HR+, the Base Station provides both you and your doctor with a clearer understanding of your cardiorespiratory health. Items in the Base Station are modular, meaning that you can opt for specific devices or the whole product suite, depending on recommendations from your medical professional. They can then be utilised in accordance with a prescribed schedule, or any time you feel the need for a closer look at what’s going on under the hood. Just as with our Zone Series of wearable devices, your data is then collated and analysed through our state of the art software suite - Pulse Logistics.</p>
									<h3>ECG Chest Strap</h3>
									<p>While the Zone series utilises optical sensors to monitor your heart activity round-the-clock, our Chest Strap directly observes your heart’s electrical activity, providing an ECG readout directly to Pulse Logistics. Materials used in its construction are strong and durable, yet comfortable enough to be worn for either brief observations or throughout prolonged activity.</p>
									<h3>Blood Pressure Cuff</h3>
									<p>About 1 in 10 Australians (and 1 in 3 Amercians) are reported as having hypertension (high blood pressure) or pre-hypertension symptoms. At-risk clients may be in need of regular blood pressure (BP) monitoring from the comfort of their own home, while getting that data to their doctor in a timely fashion can prompt speedy interventions when necessary. Our digital blood pressure cuff acts as the big brother to the Zone HR+ to provide you with a fast and accurate BP readout on an easy-to-read digital screen. Integrating with Pulse Logistics to analyse your data and forward it to your medical professional, giving you the piece of mind you need to stay on top of your health.</p>
									<h3>Digital Stethoscope</h3>
									<p>Listening to the sounds of the heart and body remains an important practice in early detection of cardiac dysfunction. You or your doctor may want to confirm a prognosis by listening for irregularities in cardiac, arterial or respiratory sounds. Our digital stethoscope allows just that - incorporating the most advanced signal detection available, combined with real time transmission of sound files to your doctor via Pulse Logistics.</p>
