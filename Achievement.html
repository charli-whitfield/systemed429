									<li><b>In 2015, Cardiotronics Australia launched a new Indigenous cardiovascular disease research clinic</b> which provides an integrated effort to provide education, improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment, particularly rheumatic heart disease.</li>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<li><b>Cardiotronic Australia has been named the Outstanding Organisation in the 2020 HESTA Australian Excellence Awards.</b> We’ve been recognized for our biomedical engineering research, advocacy and support for Australians affected by heart failure and hypertensive heart diseases. For example, we have been trialing new interventions, such as distributing implantable cardiac defibrillators for patients with or without ventricular dysfunction for patients experiencing financial hardships.</li>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<li><b>Charles Darwin University and Cardiotronics are both working for the benefit of the Northern Territory</b>, through which our experts continuously share their knowledge, capabilities and resources to enhance the outcomes of biomedical engineering and public health services.</li>

									<li><b>2019 Second prize winner of the PDMedical’s Australian Biomedical Engineering Innovation Awards (ABEIA) Competition from PDMedical Pty Ltd.</b> Our products overcame the barriers of remote monitoring in patients with limited hospital and equipment access by enabling communication between the patient monitoring system with Zone HR Monitor and Zone HR+, and PulseLogistics, our heart and blood pressure data management system – all backed up by an uninterruptible power supply via Ethernet transmission.</li>
